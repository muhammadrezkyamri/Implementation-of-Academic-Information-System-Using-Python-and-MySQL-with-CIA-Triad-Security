# Implementation of Academic Information System Using Python and MySQL with CIA Triad Security Principle
The project I created is called the ICA Academic System. This program is a Python and MySQL-based application designed to manage academic data such as student information, courses, and grades. The main goal of this system is to help the academic administration manage data more efficiently and centrally. In addition, this system implements the CIA security principle, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

From the Confidentiality aspect, the system protects user data by storing passwords in hashed form using bcrypt, ensuring that login credentials remain secure and cannot be easily misused. From the Integrity aspect, the system maintains data consistency by requiring authentication before performing important operations and by logging user activities, such as login attempts, data input, and backups. Meanwhile, from the Availability aspect, all academic data is stored in a MySQL database, allowing it to be accessed easily whenever needed by authorized users such as admins or students.

The program structure is divided into several modules, including the database connection module, login system, student management, course management, grade input, and data backup. The admin can add new students, view student lists, input grades, view grades, manage courses, and perform database backups to keep data secure. Students, on the other hand, can log in using their NIM (student ID) and password to view their personal information and academic results.

Before running the program, users must install Python 3 and MySQL. Then, they need to create the database in phpMyAdmin using the provided SQL script and adjust the connection configuration in the db.py file. After setup is complete, the program can be executed from the main file akademik_ica.py. Once launched, users will see the main menu with options such as admin login, registration, student login, and exit.

Overall, this system simplifies the management of academic data and ensures that it is organized, secure, and efficient. It also serves as a simple example of how cybersecurity principles—particularly the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)—can be implemented in an educational information system.
